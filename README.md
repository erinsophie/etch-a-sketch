Etch-a-Sketch

This project combines HTML, CSS and Javascript to create an online version of the game etch-a-sketch!

This one was pretty fun and I actually enjoyed playing around with it after I was done :)

In this project I wanted to create smaller functions that are more easily readable and try to avoid creating overly-lengthy functions that do too many things at once. This is easier and quicker for me to read personally and hopefully for other people too. I feel that shorter functions that are limited to not doing too many things are more efficient than longer ones (especially when it comes to naming as well), so this is something that I'm trying to be aware of. I'm also conscious of creating function names that use nouns and verbs so that they are more easily readable as well.

This project is part of the Odin Project Curriculum!
